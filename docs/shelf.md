# Shelf Tools

Kartaverse has its own set of custom Houdini shelves. Building the shelves and refining these tools and the icons used is an ongoing WIP R&D process that will evolve further over time, based upon end user feedback. 

The Kartaverse shelf items streamline the most common artist-driven XR post-production workflow steps down to a few single-click actions which you can then modify in a parametric fashion. 

These shelf tools will be available on the [Kartaverse for Houdini GitHub project page](https://github.com/Kartaverse/Kartaverse-for-Houdini) where issues can be reported, and feedback can be collected.
